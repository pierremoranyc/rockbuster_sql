This CTE includes all the necessary columns for our subsequent analysis. In the second step, we execute a query that left joins this CTE with the 'total_amount_paid' table. 
This query allows us to gain valuable insights into the distribution of top customers across different countries, 
providing a deeper understanding of our customer base in each location.
